/* This file adds optional material to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at https://flapkan.com/mpmb/charsheets and builds off the code of many fantastic people before me (MPMB in particular, but Nod Hero and others as well). It would not exist without them. Some of this code will only work on version 13.09

===Import this file using the "Add Extra Materials" option.

-KEEP IN MIND-
It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information (i.e. before making your character with it). Additionally, due to the length of some descriptions, you'll need to auto-size the font & hide the lines for multi-line fields in your settings. Otherwise, many of these items will run off the page.

/*  Subject: Flavored Items from AL adventures

    Effect:	This script adds the flavored versions of standard magic items found in AL adventures to the MPMB sheet (and a couple flavored book items). They will all be listed as AL [item category] in the Magic Item selection, which will bring a pop up for individual items sorted by item name and then module. The module codes are listed with the most complete version that I was able to track down. Your DM may have given you a shorter version.

	The main categories are as follows:
	
	Accessories (Belts, Bracers, Gauntlets, Gloves, Scarves, Wraps), Amulets, Ammunition, Bags (Bags, Haversacks, Pouches), Books (Books, Grimoires, Manuals, Tomes), Cloaks, Cloaks (Common), Clothing (Capes, Mantles, Robes), Containers (Bottles, Bowls, Decanters, Holes, Jugs, Quivers, Tankards), Eyewear (Eyes, Glasses, Goggles), Figurines, Footwear (Boots, Slippers), Headwear (Caps, Circlets, Hats, Headbands, Helms), Horns, Instruments (Bardic, Bell Branches, Chimes, Pipes (musical)), Jewelry (Brooches/Pins, Emblems, Medallions, Necklaces, Periapts, Scarabs, Talismans), Light Sources (Candles and Lanterns mostly), Minerals (Gems, Shards, Orbs), Rings, Rods, Sticks (Canes, Poles), Stones, Tattoos, Transport (Boats, Brooms, Carpets, Horseshoes, Saddles), and Wands. The Equipment category (separated into Common and otherwise) has everything else.
	
	For ease of coding & to cut down on the categories, all staffs are in the AL_Magic_Weapons file, regardless of whether you can use them to hit things or not. All Sentient items with actual stats are in the AL Special Items file under new items, even if they're sentient version of existing things.
	
	This isn't a complete list since I don't have every published adventure, but it's a start. If you don't see an item listed from a season marked complete, it should be because there was no flavor.*/

		descriptionFull : "During a time immemorable, and a year unknowable, the hottest blacksmith entered the most fabulous forge in a kingdom of great importance, to its citizens at least.\n   Grasping his hammer firmly, he stared deeply into the flames. Watching the curves of each tantalizing flicker, brow moist from the heat, desire began to overwhelm him.\n   Ever so gently his fingers stretched, reaching until he felt a familiar rough and cool alloy flush against his skin.\n   Ore from the sky. Ball of fire streaking across the heavens. Two shepherds nearly caught in the heat of the night. Livestock scattered. Warm glow faded in the morning light.\n   He slid the first piece of iron in, fire roaring as it received his load. In and out, in and out, thrusting deep into the forge, melding metal and heat together, the blacksmith worked into the night.\n   Ore from the earth. Veins pulsing in darkness. Arms swinging picks in rhythm. Grunting with exertion, a mass of bodies tugging and pulling to release the precious metal.\n   Up and down, his hammer swinging true. White hot alloy folding into white hot alloy. Pounding and pounding, flames licking the head with each purposeful stroke.\n   Ore of the Sky, ore of the earth, one in the forge's embrace.\n   Sparks flying, stinging against flesh, he gasped. Pain swirling with pleasure, the force of the furnace slamming against him as a pair of gauntlets began to take shape.\n   Pressing on, red glow creeping up the shaft of his hammer, his calloused hands perspiring as the heat drew ever closer. The malleability of metal, the malleability of man; was he shaping the gauntlets, or was the gauntlet shaping him?\n   Sweat and steam; hands and hammer; ingots and iron; surrendering to the forge, screaming to the rhythm of the craft, he pushed the masterpiece to completion.\n   In the morning, bare chest dripping, he collapsed, finished. Waking up a few days later, the gauntlets were missing, vanished without a trace.\n   Taken by a nameless ne'er-do-well, the cowardly thief themselves was lost history when a rock fell from the sky, crushing them.\n   Maybe the rock was really a spelljamming ship. The next record of the gauntlets has them being tossed into a chest by a pair of distracted deckhands who'd snuck away for some recreation.\n   The gauntlets slammed around inside the chest in the hold of a hammerhead ship for years before the ship was rammed by space dwarves, who used it for a monstrous plot. The attackers blasted their way into the hold and pounded the chest open.\n   One of the space dwarves grabbed the gauntlets roughly, later coming together with a tiefling dragon chosen. The gauntlets were taken in the early morning over a game of cards.\n   Tying the knot up in this story, the gauntlets were claimed in the Assault on the Giffstar to protect Bestspace from the evil alliance of Godfried and Nicolli.\n   The blacksmith's screams of creation are imbued in these gauntlets, granting the guardian property.\n   " + toUni("Guardian") + ".

It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane's environment can't harm its occupants. Everything else that can be interacted with there can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden there disappears if it is taken outside the demiplane.\n   For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. Also, creatures don't age while there, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).\n   When the time runs out or you take a Magic action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an unoccupied space nearest that location.
