/* This file adds optional material to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at https://flapkan.com/mpmb/charsheets and builds off the code of many fantastic people before me (MPMB in particular, but Nod Hero and others as well). It would not exist without them. Some of this code will only work on version 13.09

===Import this file using the "Add Extra Materials" option.

-KEEP IN MIND-
It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information (i.e. before making your character with it). Additionally, due to the length of some descriptions, you'll need to auto-size the font & hide the lines for multi-line fields in your settings. Otherwise, many of these items will run off the page.

/*  Subject: Flavored Items from AL adventures

    Effect:	This script adds the flavored versions of standard magic items found in AL adventures to the MPMB sheet (and a couple flavored book items). They will all be listed as AL [item category] in the Magic Item selection, which will bring a pop up for individual items sorted by item name and then module. The module codes are listed with the most complete version that I was able to track down. Your DM may have given you a shorter version.

	The main categories are as follows:
	
	Accessories (Belts, Bracers, Gauntlets, Gloves, Scarves, Wraps), Amulets, Ammunition, Bags (Bags, Haversacks, Pouches), Books (Books, Grimoires, Manuals, Tomes), Cloaks, Cloaks (Common), Clothing (Capes, Mantles, Robes), Containers (Bottles, Bowls, Decanters, Holes, Jugs, Quivers, Tankards), Dolls (Talking Dolls), Eyewear (Eyes, Glasses, Goggles), Figurines, Footwear (Boots, Slippers), Headwear (Caps, Circlets, Hats, Headbands, Helms), Headwear (Common), Horns (All types), Instruments (Bardic, Bell Branches, Chimes, Pipes (musical)), Jewelry (Brooches/Pins, Emblems, Medallions, Necklaces, Periapts, Scarabs, Talismans), Light Sources (Candles, Lanters, light-giving Globes and Gems), Minerals (Crystals, Gems, Orbs, Spheres), Rings, Rods, Shards, Sticks (Canes, Poles), Stones, Tattoos, Transport (Boats, Brooms, Carpets, Horseshoes, Saddles), Wands, and Wands (Common). The Equipment category (separated into Common and otherwise) has everything else.
	
	For ease of coding & to cut down on the categories, all staffs are in the AL_Magic_Weapons file, regardless of whether you can use them to hit things or not. All Sentient items with actual stats are in the AL Special Items file under new items, even if they're sentient version of existing things.
	
	This isn't a complete list since I don't have every published adventure, but it's a start. If you don't see an item listed from a season marked complete, it should be because there was no flavor.*/

	"    You can take a Magic action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\n   You can take a Magic action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\n   If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n   Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Heward's Handy Haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

		descriptionFull : "During a time immemorable, and a year unknowable, the hottest blacksmith entered the most fabulous forge in a kingdom of great importance, to its citizens at least.\n   Grasping his hammer firmly, he stared deeply into the flames. Watching the curves of each tantalizing flicker, brow moist from the heat, desire began to overwhelm him.\n   Ever so gently his fingers stretched, reaching until he felt a familiar rough and cool alloy flush against his skin.\n   Ore from the sky. Ball of fire streaking across the heavens. Two shepherds nearly caught in the heat of the night. Livestock scattered. Warm glow faded in the morning light.\n   He slid the first piece of iron in, fire roaring as it received his load. In and out, in and out, thrusting deep into the forge, melding metal and heat together, the blacksmith worked into the night.\n   Ore from the earth. Veins pulsing in darkness. Arms swinging picks in rhythm. Grunting with exertion, a mass of bodies tugging and pulling to release the precious metal.\n   Up and down, his hammer swinging true. White hot alloy folding into white hot alloy. Pounding and pounding, flames licking the head with each purposeful stroke.\n   Ore of the Sky, ore of the earth, one in the forge's embrace.\n   Sparks flying, stinging against flesh, he gasped. Pain swirling with pleasure, the force of the furnace slamming against him as a pair of gauntlets began to take shape.\n   Pressing on, red glow creeping up the shaft of his hammer, his calloused hands perspiring as the heat drew ever closer. The malleability of metal, the malleability of man; was he shaping the gauntlets, or was the gauntlet shaping him?\n   Sweat and steam; hands and hammer; ingots and iron; surrendering to the forge, screaming to the rhythm of the craft, he pushed the masterpiece to completion.\n   In the morning, bare chest dripping, he collapsed, finished. Waking up a few days later, the gauntlets were missing, vanished without a trace.\n   Taken by a nameless ne'er-do-well, the cowardly thief themselves was lost history when a rock fell from the sky, crushing them.\n   Maybe the rock was really a spelljamming ship. The next record of the gauntlets has them being tossed into a chest by a pair of distracted deckhands who'd snuck away for some recreation.\n   The gauntlets slammed around inside the chest in the hold of a hammerhead ship for years before the ship was rammed by space dwarves, who used it for a monstrous plot. The attackers blasted their way into the hold and pounded the chest open.\n   One of the space dwarves grabbed the gauntlets roughly, later coming together with a tiefling dragon chosen. The gauntlets were taken in the early morning over a game of cards.\n   Tying the knot up in this story, the gauntlets were claimed in the Assault on the Giffstar to protect Bestspace from the evil alliance of Godfried and Nicolli.\n   The blacksmith's screams of creation are imbued in these gauntlets, granting the guardian property.\n   " + toUni("Guardian") + ".

While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.",

On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder damage.\n   Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.",

		descriptionFull : "The Mind Fortress is the remnants of an extradimensional location that served as the site of a ritual enacted by the alchemist Ravinan. Ravinan divided three aspects of his psyche, in an attempt to purify his soul, and collapsed this evil into a stone called the Eye of Darkness. The Mind Fortress then served as the extradimensional home for the stone until liberated by adventurers. After the stone was removed, the Mind Fortress shrank to a less-potent but still useful magical item. The Mind Fortress functions in all ways as a ring of mind shielding.\n  The Mind Fortress still contains two portions of Rhys's psyche (his center for rational thought, as well as his conscience). These mental remnants do not count as an actual soul for purposes of the ring, nor do they cause the Mind Fortress to act as an intelligent item.

You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n " + toUni("Button 1") + ".  A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.\n " + toUni("Button 2") + ". The rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n  " + toUni("Button 3") + ". The rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n  " + toUni("Button 4") + ". The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n  " + toUni("Button 5") + ". The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n  " + toUni("Button 6") + ". The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.)

			"The rod of lordly might has a flanged head, and functions as a magic Mace that gives +3 attack and damage roll made with it.",
			"As a Bonus action, I can press one of the six different buttons set in a row along the haft of the rod. A button's effect lasts until a different button is pushed, or until the same button is pushed again, whereupon it reverts to its normal form.",
			"\u2022 Button 1.  A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and my blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (my choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage.",
			"\u2022 Button 2.  The rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.",
			"\u2022 Button 3.  The rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.",
			"\u2022 Button 4.  The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (I choose length), though the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert.",
			"\u2022 Button 5.  The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.",
			"\u2022 Button 6.  The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives my depth beneath the ground or my height above it.",
			"The rod also has three functions that work independent of the buttons.",
			"\u2022 Drain Life. When I hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, I can force it to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and I regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that damage. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.",
			"\u2022 Paralyze.   When I hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, I can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is Paralyzed for 1 minute. It repeats the save at the end of each of turn, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.",
			"\u2022 Terrify.    While holding the rod, I can take a Magic action to force each visible creature within 30 feet to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is Frightened for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
