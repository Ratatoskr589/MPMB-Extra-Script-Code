/* This file adds optional material to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at https://flapkan.com/mpmb/charsheets and builds off the code of many fantastic people before me (MPMB in particular, but Nod Hero and others as well). It would not exist without them. Some of this code will only work on version 13.09

===Import this file using the "Add Extra Materials" option.

-KEEP IN MIND-
It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information (i.e. before making your character with it). Additionally, due to the length of some descriptions, I recommend auto-sizing font & hiding the lines for multi-line fields. Otherwise, many of these items will run off the page.

/*  Subject: Flavored Items from AL adventures

    Effect:	This script adds the flavored versions of standard magic items found in AL adventures to the MPMB sheet (and a couple flavored book items). They will all be listed as AL [item category] in the Magic Item selection, which will bring a pop up for individual items sorted by item name and then module. The module codes are listed with the most complete version that I was able to track down. Your DM may have given you a shorter version.

	The main categories are as follows:
	
	Accessories (Belts, Bracers, Gauntlets, Gloves, Tattoos), Ammunition, Books (Books, Grimoires, Manuals, Tomes), Containers (Bags, Bottles, Bowls, Decanters, Haversacks, Holes, Jugs, Pouches, Quivers, Tankards), Eyewear (Eyes, Glasses, Goggles), Figurines, Footwear (Boots, Slippers), Headwear (Caps, Circlets, Hats, Headbands, Helms), Instruments (Bardic, Chimes, Horns, Pipes (musical)), Jewelry (Amulets, Brooches/Pins, Emblems, Medallions, Necklaces, Periapts, Scarabs. Talismans), Light Sources (Candles and Lanterns mostly), Minerals (Gems, Stones, Orbs), Outerwear (Capes, Cloaks, Mantles, Robes), Rings, Rods, Transport (Boats, Brooms, Carpets, Horseshoes, Saddles), and Wands. The Equipment category has everything else.
	
	For ease of coding & to cut down on the categories, all staffs are in the AL_Magic_Weapons file, regardless of whether you can use them to hit things or not. All Sentient items with actual stats are in the AL Special Items file under new items, even if they're sentient version of existing things.
	
	This isn't a complete list since I don't have every published adventure, but it's a start. If you don't see an item listed from a season marked complete, it should be because there was no flavor.*/

		descriptionFull : "This thick tome contains pages of thin, hammered copper and has thin covers of slate. It is held shut by a severed elven tongue. Occasionally, the attuned user of this spellbook finds messages that have been scrawled by someone claiming to be Netherese; this ghostly writer refers to itself simply as “the warlock” and frequently opines on the power of the one true god of magic: Mystryl.\n   Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The grisly cover decoration on the first tome of the stilled tongue once belonged to a treacherous former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.\n   If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic components. Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.\n   While attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.\n   Vecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.",

Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.\n   If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\n   Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

The basin’s command phrase is inscribed in Primordial (Aquan) with glyphs inlaid in silver along its inside lip. Being able to read or understand Primordial is not needed to use the bowl’s magic, as merely focusing on the bowl reveals its command phrase: “From the Plane of Water, I wrench thee; From the Archomental, I bind thee”\n   While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the Conjure Elemental spell.

		descriptionFull : "This item is always chilly to the touch and, at first sight, appears to be a solid iron ball not unlike a large bearing. Closer inspection reveals fine lines that make up minutely elaborate whorls and swirls on the ball’s surface. Even closer inspection reveals short passages written in celestial runes. Anyone who can read celestial or who uses a comprehend languages spell (or an otherwise similar ability) discerns the following sentence—the sphere’s command phrase—in the writing: “Bind the Stinger to the floor and force the singer to sing no more.”\n   This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.\n   Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.\n   A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.\n   Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.",

		descriptionFull : "The Mind Fortress is the remnants of an extradimensional location that served as the site of a ritual enacted by the alchemist Ravinan.

		descriptionFull : "This marvelously crafted statuette depicting the silver dragon Pharyssolnyth is of solid silver and conceals an immovable rod. The rod cannot be removed from the statuette. Depressing the dragon’s head pushes the rod’s button.\n   Possessing the rod for 24 hours gives its possessor proficiency in the Draconic language as long as they have the statuette on their person.\n   This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.",
