/* This file adds optional material to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at https://flapkan.com/mpmb/charsheets and builds off the code of many fantastic people before me (MPMB in particular, but Nod Hero and others as well). It would not exist without them. Some of this code will only work on version 13.09

===Import this file using the "Add Extra Materials" option.

-KEEP IN MIND-
It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information (i.e. before making your character with it). Additionally, due to the length of some descriptions, you'll need to auto-size the font & hide the lines for multi-line fields in your settings. Otherwise, many of these items will run off the page.

/*  Subject: Flavored Items from AL adventures

    Effect:	This script adds the flavored versions of standard magic items found in AL adventures to the MPMB sheet (and a couple flavored book items). They will all be listed as AL [item category] in the Magic Item selection, which will bring a pop up for individual items sorted by item name and then module. The module codes are listed with the most complete version that I was able to track down. Your DM may have given you a shorter version.

	The main categories are as follows:
	
	Accessories (Belts, Bracers, Gauntlets, Gloves, Scarves, Wraps), Amulets, Ammunition, Bags (Bags, Haversacks, Pouches), Books (Books, Grimoires, Manuals, Tomes), Cloaks, Cloaks (Common), Clothing (Capes, Mantles, Robes), Containers (Bottles, Bowls, Decanters, Holes, Jugs, Quivers, Tankards), Eyewear (Eyes, Glasses, Goggles), Figurines, Footwear (Boots, Slippers), Headwear (Caps, Circlets, Hats, Headbands, Helms), Horns, Instruments (Bardic, Bell Branches, Chimes, Pipes (musical)), Jewelry (Brooches/Pins, Emblems, Medallions, Necklaces, Periapts, Scarabs, Talismans), Light Sources (Candles and Lanterns mostly), Minerals (Gems, Shards, Orbs), Rings, Rods, Sticks (Canes, Poles), Stones, Tattoos, Transport (Boats, Brooms, Carpets, Horseshoes, Saddles), and Wands. The Equipment category (separated into Common and otherwise) has everything else.
	
	For ease of coding & to cut down on the categories, all staffs are in the AL_Magic_Weapons file, regardless of whether you can use them to hit things or not. All Sentient items with actual stats are in the AL Special Items file under new items, even if they're sentient version of existing things.
	
	This isn't a complete list since I don't have every published adventure, but it's a start. If you don't see an item listed from a season marked complete, it should be because there was no flavor.*/

		descriptionFull : "During a time immemorable, and a year unknowable, the hottest blacksmith entered the most fabulous forge in a kingdom of great importance, to its citizens at least.\n   Grasping his hammer firmly, he stared deeply into the flames. Watching the curves of each tantalizing flicker, brow moist from the heat, desire began to overwhelm him.\n   Ever so gently his fingers stretched, reaching until he felt a familiar rough and cool alloy flush against his skin.\n   Ore from the sky. Ball of fire streaking across the heavens. Two shepherds nearly caught in the heat of the night. Livestock scattered. Warm glow faded in the morning light.\n   He slid the first piece of iron in, fire roaring as it received his load. In and out, in and out, thrusting deep into the forge, melding metal and heat together, the blacksmith worked into the night.\n   Ore from the earth. Veins pulsing in darkness. Arms swinging picks in rhythm. Grunting with exertion, a mass of bodies tugging and pulling to release the precious metal.\n   Up and down, his hammer swinging true. White hot alloy folding into white hot alloy. Pounding and pounding, flames licking the head with each purposeful stroke.\n   Ore of the Sky, ore of the earth, one in the forge’s embrace.\n   Sparks flying, stinging against flesh, he gasped. Pain swirling with pleasure, the force of the furnace slamming against him as a pair of gauntlets began to take shape.\n   Pressing on, red glow creeping up the shaft of his hammer, his calloused hands perspiring as the heat drew ever closer. The malleability of metal, the malleability of man; was he shaping the gauntlets, or was the gauntlet shaping him?\n   Sweat and steam; hands and hammer; ingots and iron; surrendering to the forge, screaming to the rhythm of the craft, he pushed the masterpiece to completion.\n   In the morning, bare chest dripping, he collapsed, finished. Waking up a few days later, the gauntlets were missing, vanished without a trace.\n   Taken by a nameless ne’er-do-well, the cowardly thief themselves was lost history when a rock fell from the sky, crushing them.\n   Maybe the rock was really a spelljamming ship. The next record of the gauntlets has them being tossed into a chest by a pair of distracted deckhands who’d snuck away for some recreation.\n   The gauntlets slammed around inside the chest in the hold of a hammerhead ship for years before the ship was rammed by space dwarves, who used it for a monstrous plot. The attackers blasted their way into the hold and pounded the chest open.\n   One of the space dwarves grabbed the gauntlets roughly, later coming together with a tiefling dragon chosen. The gauntlets were taken in the early morning over a game of cards.\n   Tying the knot up in this story, the gauntlets were claimed in the Assault on the Giffstar to protect Bestspace from the evil alliance of Godfried and Nicolli.\n   The blacksmith’s screams of creation are imbued in these gauntlets, granting the guardian property.\n   " + toUni("Guardian") + ".

A creature that puts an ear to the amulet can hear faint ticking and whirring noises coming from within.\n   When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. Once used. this property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n   " + toUni("Muttering") + ". The item grumbles and mutters. A creature who listens carefully to the item might learn something useful.",

This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for 1d12 hours.",

If the mephit is released it is under the control of the DM and immediately tries to escape.\n   You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of murky fresh water or briny salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn.

As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.",

			descriptionFull : "This wand has been transformed into an alien, glassy green crystal that's cold to the touch and morphs its appearance slightly overnight. When within 5 feet of a portal to the Far Realm, the wand glows a sickly green and writhes like a snake.\n   The wand has 7 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the wand in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: Ray of Frost (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +5 to hit with ranged spell attack), Sleet Storm (3 charges; spell save DC 15), or Ice Storm (4 charges; spell save DC 15). No components are required. The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the wand melts away, forever destroyed.",

				"As an action I can expend 1 of the wand's 7 charges and choose a target within 120 ft of me. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll a d100 and consult the effect below to discover what happens.",
				"If the effect causes me to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 ft if it isn't already.",
				"If an effect covers an area, I must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which ones are affected.",
				"\nd100 RESULT AND EFFECTS",

				"06-10: I cast Faerie Fire.",
				"11-15: I am stunned until the start of my next turn, believing something awesome just happened.",
				"16-20: I cast Gust of Wind.",
				"21-25: I cast Detect Thoughts on the target I chose. If I didn't target a creature, I instead take 1d6 psychic damage.",

				"31-33: Heavy rain falls in a 60-ft radius centered on the target. The area becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until the start of my next turn.",
				"34-36: An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal isn't under my control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 01-25, a rhinoceros appears; on a 26-50, an elephant appears; and on a 51-100, a rat appears.",
				"37-46: I cast Lightning Bolt.",
				"47-49: A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-ft radius centered on the target. The area becomes heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes.",
				"50-53: I enlarge the target as if I had cast Enlarge/Reduce. If the target can't be affected by that spell or if I didn't target a creature, I become the target.",
				"54-58: I cast Darkness.",
