If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed.

If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\n   Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

Each pot contains enough paint to cover 1000 sq ft, which can turn into 10000 cu ft of nonmagical inanimate objects or terrain features. Those become real upon completion of a painting. It takes 10 min to paint 100 sq ft. Nothing created can have a value over 25 gp and objects appearing of greater value look authentic but don't hold up to closer inspection. I can use this to paint, for example, a door on a wall and then walk through it, or a pit on the floor and have my enemies fall into it. I can't use this to form energy that deals damage, like fire or lightning.",
		descriptionFull : "Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\n   Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features\u2014such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons\u2014that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\n   When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\n   Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\n   If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.",

This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.",
	">>Thrown Weapon<<. Whelm has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.",
	">>Shock Wave<<. You can use an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.",
	">>Supernatural Awareness<<. While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast Detect Evil and Good or Locate Object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.",

Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire.
