/* This file adds optional material to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at https://flapkan.com/mpmb/charsheets and builds off the code of many fantastic people before me (MPMB in particular, but others as noted). It would not exist without them.

===Import this file using the "Add Extra Materials" bookmark.
-KEEP IN MIND-
It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information (i.e. before making your character with it).
Additionally, due to the length of some descriptions, you'll need to auto-size the font & hide the lines for multi-line fields in your settings. Otherwise, many of these items will run off the page.

/*  Subject: Flavored Armor from AL adventures
Effect:	This script adds the flavored versions of standard magic armor and shields found in AL adventures to the MPMB sheet. They will all be listed as AL [categories] in the Magic Item selection, with further choices as needed. Helms can be found in the AL Magic Items script as most do not provide AC.

This is not a complete list since I do not have every published adventure, but it's a start. If you do not see an item listed from a season marked complete, it should be because there was no flavor.*/
