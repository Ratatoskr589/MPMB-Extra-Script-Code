/*	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
	This file contains contributions from many different people over on the /r/mpmb subreddit and
	the MPMB Discord server.

	Many contributions have been reworked by Safety-Orange to fix bugs, make texts more uniform,
	adhere to MPMB's standards, and/or adhere to the latest syntax version.
	Combined with the fact that many contributions haven't been individually tracked (on GitHub),
	it is no longer possible to assign specific additions to a single person.

	Instead, here is a list of people (account names on GitHub) who made contributions,
	helped collect materials, or were otherwise essential to this script coming to fruition,
	in no particular order:
