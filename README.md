# MPMB-Extra Scripts for Official Content

Exactly what it sounds like. This is all my script code for official content that can be used with More Purple More Better's character sheet. This is primarily AL magic items that have extra flavor or were specially created for modules and events. It also includes mechanical Story Awards, some special creatures, and backgrounds from Guild Adept content/other supplements.

IMPORTANT: The AL Magic Items file breaks the individual magic items exclusion button on the Source page. I think this is due to the sheer number of items it contains as I haven't been able to find an error causing that in the sheet. If that changes, I'll post a fix, but for now you need to install any other files and exclude/include items before adding AL Magic Items. The default excluded items in that file can all be added back in via the source instead.
